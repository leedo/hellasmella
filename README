CONFIGURATION

Before you install HellaSmella make sure that you have edited 'hellasmella.yml'!

You will need to set at least one username and password which is used
to access hellanzb through your browser. You will also need to configure your
hellanzb daemon IP, port, and password. Optionally you can set a Newzbin login
and password.


INSTALLATION

Run 'perl Makefile.PL'. This will let you know if you are missing any dependencies, 
and ask if you want to install them via CPAN. Next run 'make' and then as root
run 'make install'. This will install the required files into /usr/local/.


SETTING UP YOUR WEBSERVER

HellaSmella is able to run as a CGI script, FastCGI application, or as a mod_perl handler.
I run it as a FastCGI script that is spawned from lighttpd. You can find my configuration
in the ex/ directory.

For other deployment options take a look at the Catalyst Cookbook on CPAN:
